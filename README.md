# SunshineWatchfaceApp
A companion Android watch face app to Udacity's Sunshine weather app. It's a digital watch face, which, alongside date and time, also displays the highest and lowest temperatures for that day.

To run the mobile app, add the line, MyOpenWeatherMapApiKey = "Your_weather_map_api_key" to the gradle.properties file.
